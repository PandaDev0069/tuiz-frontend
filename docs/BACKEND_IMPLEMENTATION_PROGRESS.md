   - Implement session lifecycle management
   - Add player presence tracking

2. **Implement Real-time Events**
   - Create Socket.IO event handlers
   - Implement game state synchronization
   - Add player connection management

3. **Build Game API Endpoints**
   - Create game session management endpoints
   - Implement answer submission system

### Testing Strategy

1. **Unit Tests**: Add tests for game session functions
2. **Integration Tests**: Test real-time functionality
3. **Load Tests**: Test with 300-400 concurrent connections
4. **E2E Tests**: Complete game flow testing

## Conclusion

The TUIZ backend has an **excellent foundation** with **85% of the infrastructure complete**. The database schema, authentication, API structure, and security are all production-ready. However, the **critical missing piece** is the **real-time game session management** that enables multiplayer quiz gameplay.

**Next Milestone**: Implement game session database schema and real-time Socket.IO events to enable live multiplayer quiz sessions.

**Estimated Time to MVP**: 1-2 weeks with focused development on game session management.

**Risk Factors**:

- Socket.IO connection limits with 300-400 concurrent users
- Database performance with real-time updates
- State synchronization complexity

The backend is well-positioned for rapid completion once the game session management layer is implemented.
