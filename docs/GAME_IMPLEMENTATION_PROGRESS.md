   - Implement room code generation
   - Add game lifecycle management

### Testing Strategy

1. **Unit Tests**: Add tests for game components
2. **Integration Tests**: Test real-time functionality
3. **Load Testing**: Test with 300-400 concurrent users
4. **E2E Tests**: Complete game flow testing

## Conclusion

The TUIZ project has made significant progress with **80% of UI components completed** and a solid foundation for the quiz game system. The main gap is the **real-time infrastructure** that connects the frontend components to create a seamless multiplayer experience.

**Next Milestone**: Implement real-time game flow with WebSocket integration to enable live multiplayer quiz sessions.

**Estimated Time to MVP**: 2-3 weeks with focused development on real-time features.

**Risk Factors**:

- Supabase Realtime limitations with 300-400 concurrent users
- WebSocket connection stability
- Mobile performance optimization

The project is well-positioned for rapid completion once the real-time infrastructure is implemented.
