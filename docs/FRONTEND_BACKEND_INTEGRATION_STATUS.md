## 🎯 Integration Plan

### Phase 1: API Service Layer ✅ COMPLETED

**Timeline: 1-2 hours**

1. **Create Quiz Service** (`src/lib/quizService.ts`) ✅
   - API client with authentication headers ✅
   - Error handling with toast notifications ✅
   - Loading state management ✅
   - Backend endpoint integration ✅

2. **Create API Types** (`src/types/api.ts`) ✅
   - Request/response interfaces ✅
   - Error response types ✅
   - API endpoint constants ✅

### Phase 2: Form Integration (Priority: HIGH)

**Timeline: 2-3 hours**

1. **BasicInfoStep Integration** ✅ COMPLETED
   - save draft functionality ✅
   - Real-time validation ✅
   - Error display from backend ✅
   - Image upload integration ✅

2. **QuestionCreationStep Integration** ✅ COMPLETED
   - Save questions to backend ✅
   - Real-time question validation ✅
   - Image upload integration ✅
   - Batch saving on Next button ✅

3. **SettingsStep Integration** ✅ COMPLETED
   - Save play settings ✅
   - Code generation integration ✅
   - Real-time code validation ✅

4. **FinalStep Integration** ✅ COMPLETED
   - Quiz validation before publish ✅
   - Real publishing mechanism ✅
   - Success/error feedback with toast notifications ✅
   - Automatic dashboard redirect ✅

### Phase 3: Enhanced Features (Priority: MEDIUM)

**Timeline: 1-2 hours**

1. **Draft Management**
   - Load existing drafts
   - Auto-save functionality
   - Draft restoration

2. **Real-time Validation**
   - Validate quiz data on backend
   - Show validation errors/warnings
   - Prevent publishing invalid quiz

## ⚠️ Critical Risks & Mitigation

### Risk 1: Authentication Token Management

**Issue:** Frontend auth tokens may expire during form completion
**Mitigation:** Implement token refresh mechanism in quiz service

### Risk 2: Form Data Loss

**Issue:** No auto-save means users lose work on page refresh
**Mitigation:** Implement draft saving in Phase 1

### Risk 3: API Error Handling

**Issue:** Backend errors not properly displayed to users
**Mitigation:** Unified error handling with user-friendly messages

### Risk 4: Image Upload Integration

**Issue:** Image uploads not connected to backend storage
**Mitigation:** Implement image upload service with Supabase storage

## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details
