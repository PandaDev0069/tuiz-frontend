# Prompt File: [Feature / Page / Component Name]

We are going to **develop the [Feature/Page/Component]**.

---

## üéØ Main Purpose

- What this feature does: [Explain briefly, e.g., "Allows users to upload and manage their files."]
- Why it matters: [e.g., "Core part of the user experience for handling personal data."]

---

## üõ† Procedures

1. **Break down the feature into reusable UI components**:
   - [Component 1]
   - [Component 2]
   - [Component 3]

2. **Assemble the final layout**:
   - [Structure, e.g., Sidebar + Top Bar + Main Section]

3. **Integrate logic**:
   - [API calls, state management, hooks]

## ‚ö° Design & Styling Rules

- Background: [Global or unique?]
- Color Palette: [Primary, secondary, accents]
- Components should follow [UI theme or variation rules].
- Responsive layout: [Desktop first / Mobile first / Both]

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Things to Take in Caution

- Reuse existing components if available.
- If a component needs customization ‚Üí extend, don‚Äôt duplicate.
- Maintain consistency with existing design system.
- Handle edge cases (loading, empty, error states).

---

## üìê Additional Guidelines

- Naming conventions:
  - Components: `PascalCase`
  - CSS/Tailwind classes: [BEM/utility-first/custom rule]
- Keep separation of concerns:
  - UI vs logic
  - Components vs hooks/services
- Add comments for complex logic.
- Accessibility considerations (contrast, alt text, keyboard navigation).
- Testing:
  - Component-level tests
  - Integration with parent layout

## ‚úÖ Next Action

Following the above rules, **execute the next development step**.  
Start with [UI components / API integration / Layout] depending on priority.
